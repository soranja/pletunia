# Pletunia v. 2.0.1 ✨

Welcome to **Pletunia**, a small but meaningful project built to support my wife’s first business. ✨  
She’s an incredibly creative person, making beautiful art pieces using the paper cut-out technique. This website is my way of helping her share that art with the world.

## 💌 THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Right now, the website allows you to do one main thing: **order postcards**.

- Browse postcards (all original designs).
- Fill out a simple order form.
- Receive a confirmation email in your chosen language (EN/RU).
- After that, we’ll personally contact you by email to arrange payment and delivery.

---

## 🎯 FUTURE PLANS

We’re planning to grow Pletunia step by step:

- Add more postcard designs.
- Implement proper e-commerce features: shopping cart, payment system, delivery details.
- Possibly expand further with a **blog**, **about us**, and **news/updates** section.

✅ **Constructor Set section is successfully added** (2025 refactor).

## 🚀 DEV NOTES

This used to be my **first relatively big project**, and progress has been slow at times because:

- I’ve been **learning a lot of new tools and concepts** while building.
- I’ve done several **rebuilds and refactors** to improve structure and performance (2023, 2025).

Originally built with **CRA**, the project was later **migrated to Next.js 15**.

🌍 **Languages supported**: English and Russian (including postcard names and email confirmations).
